Introduction:
What is the Homeric tradition? Which manuscripts will I be looking at? etc.
[Big question that I am seeking to answer]
Somewhere in here, I probably need to introduce the people who will be frequently named (Zenodotus, Aristarchus, Aristonichus, etc) and explain how their scholarly traditions relate to each other. Personally, I like the idea of taking a historic detour before getting into all the technical stuff. Not only will it acquaint readers with necessary terms, but acknowledging the people behind the traditions adds to the "why should I care" factor. (Maybe there isn't supposed to be a "why should I care" factor in a thesis, but why should I care?)

Section One: Intro to Topic Modelling
How is it done?
Discuss Professor Smith's new parsing program, and the advantages to using it over Morpheus
"When the topic modelling is done, we can expect to see multiple clusters of words; these clusters have no inherent meaning, but we can assign them meaning"

Section Two: Show the Results of Topic Modelling
These are which clusters showed up for each manuscript's scholia
Conclusions from that?

Section Three: The Aristarchan Critical Signs
Discuss the page at the beginning of the Ven A
Add footnote discussing work with Professor Smith and Professor Bird on translation
Images of critical signs for reference

Section Four: Topic Modelling With Critical Signs
Are there words and critical signs that frequently co-occur?
Back to Aristonichus - are the critical signs used the way he said they would be?
Are the critical signs used the same in each manuscript? Which clusters show up for which critical signs in which manuscripts?
This seems like a good place for a table, because there's a lot of info here. 

Section Five: What Can We Learn From This?
What does this say about how the manuscripts were made, and how each scribe viewed his own work?
Specifically, I want to know if the Ven A scribe obeyed Aristonichus. It would be interesting if he copied down the page, meaning he saw it as valuable, but then used the critical signs in a different way (i.e. the way they had come to be used in his time period).
