"οικονομια - deployment, arrangement, order (of subject matter, hence:) plot"  (Nunlist, 378 - glossary)
"the notion of arranging subject matter in a particular way" (Nunlist, 24)
Often refers to questions of motivation (Nunlist, 27); justifying a crucial moment's inclusion at all, as opposed to at a particular point
"The Homeric scholia [when talking about οικονομια] tend to focus on the connection between two specific passages in the text, one of which motivates the other" (Nunlist 28) - LOOK OUT FOR THIS
"Because of its origin in husbandry (Quint, 3.3.9), the word οικονομιαis well suited to describe the activity of a poet who gives the parts of his literary text an 'economic' disposition" (Nunlist, 33)
    * What does that mean??? Basically the goal is to produce a "taut plot" (Nunlist 33). When, in Oedipus at Colonus, Theseus hears the chorus alerting him that his daughters have been kidnapped, that eliminates the need for a messenger. Thus, the plot is neater and more condensed.
    * "Ideally, the poem resembles the organic structure of a living organism and is not in any respect deficient or redundant" (Nunlist 33). Was Nunlist born with one kidney or something? Regardless, he seems to be saying that 'survival of the fittest' applies to poetry in a way. If you want your poem to succeed, give it everything it needs for the plot to function and nothing that would complicate it further.
"It has been claimed that ancient literary critics made a difference between prolepsis and motivation ([προ]οικονομια)... Προοικονομειν always means 'to motivate in advance, to prepare for.' This may, at times, include the notion 'to adumbrate, to hint at,' but never goes so far as to indicate prolepseis" (Nunlist, 42)
Contrast οικονομια with ταξις, which means "natural order." From what I can tell so far, οικονομια seems more intentional on the part of the poet. Still we can find out by searching for ταξις in the scholia.
