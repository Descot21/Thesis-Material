  A majority of my thesis will be achieved through topic modelling. The computer will show me which words often appear in conjunction with each other, forming clusters. From there, I will analyze these clusters to see if they have any significance. My main focus will be on clusters pertaining to critics and their readings of the text. What the scribes chose to copy over will tell us not only what the ancient critics thought of the text, but what the 10th and 11th century scribes saw as accurate and worth preserving.
  As part of my thesis, I am working with Professors Neel Smith and Graeme Bird on transcribing and translating several texts on critical signs. I intend to compare the explicitly stated purposes of these signs with their practical applications. As the works of Aristarchus were lost within a few generations of him writing them, and subsequent scholars tried to reconstruct his work, I wonder how much cohesion there is in the application of critical signs. In terms of hypotheses, I would expect the scribes of the Twins manuscripts to use critical signs in the same way, whereas more variation might be found in the Townley and Venetus A. I especially want to examine the Venetus A, as one of our sources on the technical application of critical signs is found within it. I want to see if the scribe adhered to all of the rules he wrote out for himself.
