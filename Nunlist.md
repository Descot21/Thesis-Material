 Section: Plot
 Dionysus of Halicarnasus separates subject matter (πραγματικόν) from style (λεκτικόν)
  πραγματικόν is divided up into two sections: prepararation (παρασκευή or ευρεσις) and deployment (χρησις or οικονομια)
  λεκτικόν is divided into word choice (εκλογη των ονοματων) and composition (συνθεις)
  Deployment and composition both refer to the action of arranging, while preparation and word choice both refer to choosing
Ταξις - proper distribution of proem, narration, proof, and epilogue  
What is οικονομια? Allegedly, it can refer to motivation; a passage has οικονομια if it logically sets up subsequent events
  In Homeric scholia, this often denotes the relationship between two passages, instead of how one passage fits into the work on whole
  προοικονομειν/προπαρασκευειν - set up beforehand, especially used in the context of Homeric scholia
At the time of Aristarchus, a school of thinkers called the chorizontes denied that the Iliad and Odyssey were by the same poet
  The relation between passages of the Iliad and Odyssey in the scholia are direct attempts by Aristarchus and his followers to deny this
"The narrator's freedom to organize his plot at will implies that there are countless choices to make" (49)
  The scholiasts refer to the poet saving certain literary devices for later (φθλαττειν,ταμιευεσθια)
  This can be used for plot points too (i.e. Hector's death has to be saved for his showdown with Achilles)
Critics understood changes of scene as devices to either build or diffuse tension, depending on how they were used

Section: Time
"The tradition of determining the Iliad's story time goes back at least to the Alexandrian scholars, who were in disagreement about the number of days" (70)
  It is a common practice for scholars to determine their own time scheme for the Iliad, even if their means aren't clear
Some scholiasts use days as a point of reference within the text, others use books
The difference between story time and narrative time is not explicitly drawn by the scholiasts - that's fortunate, because I don't get it either (74)
  However, the scholiasts did believe in some difference between story time and narrative time
  "Its explanation implies that a linear form of art such as literature cannot present simultaneous events in literal simultineity, but must narrate them in successive order" (75)
Length of narrative does not equal length of action - a quick action can be described at length
Look into Aristotle's Poetics
  Epic poetry is unique in that it can describe many events going on at once, increasing the "weight" of the narrative
  Aristarchus was also big on fleshing this out
Scholiasts like to point out synchronization between what the gods are doing and what the humans are doing
Critics were likely aware of anachronities, but felt that they didn't need much explanation even if they were pointed out
εξ αναστροφης - might mean "in reverse order"?
