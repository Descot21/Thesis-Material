* dotted diple (>:) argues against either Zenodotus or Crates of Mallos - remember to look up Crates in scholia, he's part of a different branch of the literary tradition and a rival of Aristarchus. It would be interesting to see whether the scribe thought anything Crates said was worth including, or was loyal to the Aristarchan tradition, or even had access to Crates' work at all.
* Antisigma - line was transposed in the wrong order, does not fit the context
* Dotted antisigma - for passages that include tautologies
    * A tautology, because I'm going to forget, is saying the same thing twice with different words.
    * Do the visual similarities between the antisigma and the dotted antisigma mean anything? The antisigma says 'this shouldn't be here,' and the dotted antisigma says 'this shouldn't be repeated here,' I think. Or is Aristarchus not criticizing the tautologies when he marks them? Why else would he mark them though?
*** WHAT WE NEED is a way to search the scholia markers, like the way we can search for a word. Where are the antisigmas? Does the scholiast mention that these lines are in direct contradiction to oikonomia, or is it implied?
  * In this case, Schironi has told us where the antisigmas are, but still
  * Antisigmas are at Il 8.535 - 537
  * These show up in tandem with stigmatai in 538 - 540; instead of showing up on its own, the antisigma here requires extra explanation. Specifically, scholiast thinks the latter passage duplicates the former. The order there isn't intuitive. What makes the former more 'authentic'?LOOK THIS UP IN VEN A
* "The question of how Aristarchus marked tautologies seems settled: he used two separate signs...)" (Schironi, 614)
* The question is, why are tautologies such a big deal? Homeric poetry is characterized by repetition. What makes some repetition Homeric and other repetition spurious? Plus, Nunlist confirms that characterization is a big concern of the scholiasts, and presumably, the poet. Are some characters more prone to repeating themselves than others?
